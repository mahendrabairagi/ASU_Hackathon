# Arizona Robo Hackathon 2019!

[https://uto.asu.edu/events/Robo%20Hackathon](https://uto.asu.edu/events/Robo%20Hackathon)

## Goals and Objectives of Hackathon

The primary goals of the hackathon are to train and challenge the participating students by:

1. Applying their computer science and engineering knowledge and programming
 skills in robotics and AI application development;
 
1. Learning the latest technology and platform in robotics and AI Programming;

1. Exercising the engineering design process of design, implementation, simulation,
 and prototyping.

By the end of the hackathon, students should have:

- Successfully assembled SparkFun JetBot AI Kit Powered by NVIDIA Jetson Nano
 
- Developed a robotics application in AWS RoboMaker simulation environment and deployed the application to the physical SparkFun JetBot
 
- Trained the machine learning model to recognize the mascots of each participating school and redeploy the trained model to the robot

The winning team is the team that completes all missions with the highest score.

### The missions of the hackathon include:

1. Assemble JetBot

1. Bring JetBot to life (have the JetBot spin on its own)

1. Bring JetBot to life Part 2 (have the JetBot navigate the track)

1. Have JetBot navigate the track and recognize school mascots

1. Design, develop and deploy new capabilities to JetBot

## Step by step Instructions:

### 1 - Assemble JetBot
