ASU Hackathon Setup Instructions
================

AWS Robomaker is a service that makes it easy to create robotics applications at scale by extending the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with cloud services.  Robomaker provides a robotics application development environment and simulation service, both of which speed up application development and testing.  The service also provides a fleet managerment service so you can deploy and manage applications remotely.

You'll be using Robomaker to build, bundle, and deploy your robot application to your robot.

Let's get started!

-----

### Create Infrastructure
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, type **S3** in the **Find Services** search bar and click to navigate to the service.

1. Choose the **Create Bucket** button to begin creating an S3 bucket

    - Bucket name: **\<Team-Name\>**-jetbot-detect
    - Region: **us-east-1**

    ![S3 create bucket view](instructions/s3_create_bucket.png)

1. Click **Next** until reaching the **Review** step and click **Create Bucket**


### Creating a Development Environment
You'll be using the AWS RoboMaker IDE to develop your Robot Application.  This IDE is a cloud based development environment making used of a EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, type in **AWS RoboMaker** in the **Find Services** search bar and click to navigate to the service.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Development environments** and choose **Create Environment**.

1. Create a development environment with the following values:
    - General
        - Name: *Any name you choose*
        - Pre-installed Software suite: **ROS Melodic**
        - Instance type: **m4.xlarge**
    - Networking
        - VPC: **(Default)**
        - Subnets: **select a subnet**

1. This opens the environment’s detail page, click Open environment, which will open a new browser tab with the Cloud9 IDE.

This may take a few minutes to complete, but when the creation process has completed, you will see something similar to this:

## Building a Robot Application with RoboMaker
### Clone software

1. Open the RoboMaker IDE and navigate to the terminal and clone this Git repo to the development machine:
    ```
    # change to the environment directory
    $ cd ~/environment

    $ git clone https://github.com/abest0/aws-robomaker-jetbot-detect.git jetbot-detect
    ```

1. Execute the `generate_greengrass_certs` script as follows:
    ```
    $ cd jetbot-detect

    # Generate greengrass certificates into the local repository
    $ ./scripts/generate_greengrass_certs.sh
    ```

### Setup build resources
1. Open the RoboMaker IDE and navigate to the console.

1. Enable access to pull the jetbot-ros docker image
    ```
    # The following command logs in to the an AWS Elastic Container Repository (ECR) to
    # enable your machine to pull a base docker image
    $ $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --registry-ids 593875212637 --region us-east-1)
    ```

1. Install Ubuntu dependencies for cross compilation:
    ```
    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y qemu-user-static
    ```

1. Change to the `jetbot-detect/docker` directory &  Build the ARM64 docker container
    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/jetbot-detect/docker

    $ docker build -t jetbot-ros .

    ```

    The name entered after `-t` is the name of your Docker image.  You'll need this to use this name
    to build and bundle in later stages

1. Verify you can start up a container and run a basic ROS command:

    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/jetbot-detect

    $ docker run --rm -ti jetbot-ros

    # You will be dropped into the shell of the docker container
    # the prompt will be similar to the following root@83afb0b35322:/environment/jetbot-detect# 

    $ rosversion --distro

    # You should see the following result output
    > melodic


    # Type exit or Ctrl-D, to exit the container

    ```

### Build and Bundle [~30 mins]
1. Open the RoboMaker IDE and navigate to the terminal

1. Change to the **jetbot-detect** directory and build & bundle the ROS application in a docker container
    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/jetbot-detect
    
    # Build and bundle the robot application
    $ docker run --rm -ti -v $(pwd):/environment/jetbot-detect jetbot-ros

    # You will be dropped into the shell of the docker container
    # the prompt will be similar to the following root@83afb0b35322:/environment/jetbot-detect# 

    (docker)$ rosdep fix-permissions && rosdep update

    (docker)$ cd robot_ws

    (docker)$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

    (docker)$ colcon build

    (docker)$ colcon bundle

    # Type exit or Ctrl-D, to exit the container
    (docker)$ exit


    # Copy the robot application to S3
    $ aws s3 cp ./robot_ws/bundle/output.tar s3://<S3-BUCKET-NAME>/jetbot-detect/aarch64/output.tar
    ```


## Deploying with RoboMaker
When a robot application is deployed to a physical robot, AWS RoboMaker does the following:

- AWS RoboMaker creates or updates a custom Lambda in your account. The Lambda contains the logic needed for deployment. This includes robot application bundle download, ROS launch, pre- and post-checks, and other logic.

- AWS RoboMaker begins deployment to the fleet using the parallelization specified in the deployment configuration.

- AWS RoboMaker notifies AWS IoT Greengrass to run the custom Lambda on the target robot. The daemon running on the robot receives the command and runs the Lambda. If a Lambda is running when the command is received, it and all ROS process on the robot are terminated.

- The Lambda downloads and uncompresses the robot application bundle from Amazon S3. If a pre-launch script was specified, it is run. Then the Lambda starts ROS using the launch file and package specified. If a post-launch script was specified, it is run after ROS is started. Finally, the status of the deployment is updated.

### Configure Robot with Certificates
AWS RoboMaker uses X.509 certificates, managed subscriptions, AWS IoT policies, and IAM policies & roles to secure the applications that run on robots in your deployment environment.

An AWS RoboMake robot is also a Greengrass core. Core devices use certificates and policies to securely connect to AWS IoT. The certificates and policies also allow AWS IoT Greengrass to deploy configuration information, Lambda functions, connectors, and managed subscriptions to core devices

1. On your local machine, open a terminal and navigate to the location of the dowloaded security resources from the previous step.

1. Locate the IP address of robot on the OLED

1. Unzip your device certificates to the robot:

    ```
    # Copy the local security resources to the robot
    $ scp /path/to/downladed-zip/<robot-certs>.zip jetbot@<ip-addres>:/home/jetbot/robomaker-robot-certs.zip

    # SSH to the robot
    $ ssh jetbot@<ip-address>

    # Switch to the root user
    $ sudo su -s /bin/bash

    # Unzip the jetbot security credentials to greengrass certificate store
    $ unzip /home/jetbot/<greengrass-certs>.zip -d /greengrass
